# genarating-noise-less-medical-image-by-using-matlab
In this project we are going to solve ambiguity of medical images
by using fusion method (removing noise between two images)
here in this we used technologies like 
FDO(fidelity driven optimization)
DPGF(details preserving guided fusion)
by using this we generated noise less image of MRI/CT scan
